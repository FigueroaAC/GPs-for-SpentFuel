# GPs-for-SpentFuel

This repository contains scripts used to implement a Gaussian Process Regression model for spent fuel nuclide concentrations.

# Contents:

* Scripts/Kernel_Trainer.py:
This file allows for the computation of Kernels. Currently only support for the Anistropic Squared Exponential Kernel is provided.

* Scripts/Model_Comparer.py:
With this file a comparison between GP models and Cubic Spline models can be made, provided the Kernels have been precomputed.
